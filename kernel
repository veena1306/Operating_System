kernel: it is the portion of the operating system that resides in main memory.
Evolution of OS:-
    1. batch system: similar types of jobs are batched together.
       monitor start executing the first job, whn the job is completed control is passed back to monitor.
       Features:-
       i.No interaction between user and program
       ii.Jobs executed sequentially
       iii.Reduces setup time between similar jobs
       iv.CPU often idle during I/O (major disadvantage)


i.Uniprograming :- System must wait for I/O instruction to be executed before processing.
ii.Multiprograming:- When one job needs to wait for I/O, other job can be executed by the processror(processor can switch to other job)

Time Sharing System :- using multiprograming to handle multiple interactive jobs.
Processor's time is shared between multiple user.
multiple user's shares the processor's time using terminals.
Multiple users simultaneously access the system through terminals

Program:- An instance of a program running on a computer.
          A program in execution.

Characteristics :- 
          i. state.
         ii. system resources use.
        iii. A single sequnce thread of execution.

components :-
       i. An executable program.
       ii.Associated data needed by the program.
      iii.execution context of program.
