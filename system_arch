Each system is a series of levels:- 
1. Level 1
       i. Electronic circuits.
       ii.Objects are registers, memory cells and logic gates.
       iii.

2. level 2 
      i. processor's instruction set.
      ii.opearations such as add, substract, load and store.

3. Level 3
     i. concepts of procedure and subroutine.

4. Level 4
     i. Interrupts

Concepts Related to Multiprogramming
5. Level 5
    i. process as a program in execution.
    ii.suspends and resumes processs.

 6. Level 6
    i. secondary storage device.
    ii.Transfer of block of data.

Level 7
Creates logical address space for processes
Organizes virtual address space into blocks

Deal with External Objects

Level 8
Communication of information and messages between processes
Level 9
Supports long-term storage of named files
Level 10
Provides access to external devices using standardized interfaces
Level 11
Responsible for maintaining the association between the external and internal identifiers
Level 12
Provides full-featured facility for the support of processes
Level 13
Provides an interface to the OS for the user

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Microkernel architecture
    Assigns only a few essential functions to the kernel
        i.Address spaces
       ii.Interprocess communication (IPC)
      iii.Basic scheduling


Multiprograming :- one processor.
Multiprocessing :- Multiple processor.


Distributed operating systems
     Provides the illusion of a single main memory space and single secondary memory space.

Object-oriented design
    Used for adding modular extensions to a small kernel
    Enables programmers to customize an operating system without disrupting system integrity
